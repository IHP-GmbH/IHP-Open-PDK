IHP Open Source PDK project goal is to provide a fully open source Process
Design Kit and related data, which can be used to create manufacturable
designs at IHP’s facility.

As of March 2023, this repository is targeting the SG13G2 process node.

# Current status -- Preview

> **Warning**
>
> IHP is currently treating the existing content as a **preview only**.

While the SG13G2 process node and the PDK from which this open source
release was derived have been used to create many designs that have been
successfully manufactured in significant quantities, the open source PDK
is not intended to be used for production at this moment.

# SG13G2 Process Node

SG13G2 is a high performance BiCMOS technology with a 0.13 μm CMOS process. It contains bipolar
devices based on SiGe:C npn-HBT's with up to 350 GHz transition frequency ($f_T$) and 450 GHz oscillation
frequency ($f_{max}$). This process provides 2 gate oxides: A thin gate oxide for the 1.2 V digital logic and a thick
oxide for a 3.3 V supply voltage. For both modules NMOS, PMOS and isolated NMOS transistors are
offered. Further passive components like poly silicon resistors and MIM capacitors are available. The
backend option offers 5 thin metal layers, two thick metal layers (2 and 3 μm thick) and a MIM layer.
