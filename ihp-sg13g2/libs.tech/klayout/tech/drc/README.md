 ```

## Prerequisites

You need the following set of tools installed to be able to run SG13G2 DRC:

- Python 3.9+
- KLayout 0.29.0+

We have tested this using the following setup:
- Python 3.9.18
- KLayout 0.30.1

## Installation

To install the required Python packages, execute the following command in the DRC directory:

```bash
pip install -r ../../../../../requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You have the option to execute the SG13G2-DRC through either a Python script via the command-line interface [CLI](#cli) or by the Klayout graphical user interface [GUI](#gui), as detailed in the subsequent usage sections.

### CLI

The `run_drc.py` script takes your gds to run DRC rule decks with switches to select subsets of all checks.

```bash
    run_drc.py (--help | -h)
    run_drc.py --path=<file_path>
            [--table=<table_name>]... [--mp=<num_cores>] [--run_dir=<run_dir_path>]
            [--topcell=<topcell_name>] [--run_mode=<mode>] [--drc_json=<json_path>]
            [--precheck_drc] [--extra_rules] [--no_feol] [--no_beol] [--no_density]
            [--density_thr=<density_threads>] [--density_only] [--antenna]
            [--antenna_only] [--no_offgrid] [--macro_gen]
```

**Example:**

```bash
    python3 run_drc.py --path=testing/testcases/unit/activ.gds --run_mode=deep --run_dir=test_activ --no_density
```

**Options:**

```bash
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --path PATH           Path to the input GDS file to be processed.
  --table TABLE         DRC table name(s) to execute (e.g., activ, metal1). This option can be used multiple times.
  --mp MP               Number of parts to split the rule deck for parallel execution. [default: 1]
  --run_dir RUN_DIR     Dir to store all run results. If not specified, a timestamped dir under the current path will be used.
  --topcell TOPCELL     Top-level cell name to use from the input GDS.
  --density_thr DENSITY_THR
                        Number of threads to use during the density run (default: number of CPU cores).
  --run_mode {deep,flat}
                        KLayout execution mode: deep, or flat. [default: deep]
  --drc_json DRC_JSON   Path to a JSON file that defines rule values to use.
  --precheck_drc        Run a minimal set of DRC checks typically required for foundry prechecks.
  --no_feol             Disable all FEOL-related DRC checks.
  --no_beol             Disable all BEOL-related DRC checks.
  --extra_rules         Run the remaining DRC rules from the full rule set (may be slower).
  --no_density          Disable density rule checks.
  --density_only        Run only density rules.
  --antenna             Enable antenna rule checks.
  --antenna_only        Run only antenna rules.
  --no_offgrid          Disable offgrid rule checks.
  --macro_gen           Only generate the DRC rule deck without running.
```

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Note**  
> To enable the **foundry precheck rule set**, use the `--precheck_drc` switch.
>
> By default, the **main DRC rule set** is executed, which includes checks such as **density rules**.  
> To skip density checks, use the `--no_density` option.
>
> If the `--drc_json=<json_path>` option is **not specified**, the script will get rule values as following:
>
> 1. Attempt to load the **SG13G2 technology JSON file**:  
>    [SG13G2 tech JSON](../../python/sg13g2_pycell_lib/sg13g2_tech_mod.json)
>
> 2. If not found, fall back to the **default DRC rule set**:  
>    [Default DRC values](./rule_decks/default_drc_rules.json)

#### DRC Outputs

You could find the run results at your run directory if you previously specified it through `--run_dir=<run_dir_path>`. Default path of run directory is `drc_run_<date>_<time>` in current directory.

**Folder Structure of run results**

```text
üìÅ drc_run_<date>_<time>
 ‚î£ üìú drc_run_<date>_<time>.log
 ‚îó üìú main.drc
 ‚îó üìú <your_design_name>.lyrdb
 ```

The outcome includes a database (`<your_design_name>.lyrdb`) containing DRC results. You can view it by opening your gds file with: `klayout <device_name>.gds -m <your_design_name>.lyrdb`. Alternatively, you can visualize it on your GDS file using the netlist browser option in the tools menu of the KLayout GUI as illustrated in the following figures.

After selecting Marker Browser option, you could load the database file and visualize the DRC results.

### GUI

The SG13G2 also facilitates DRC execution via Klayout menus as depicted below:

First, you need to add the DRC menus to your `KLAYOUT_PATH`, you could do that by executing the following command:

```bash
KLAYOUT_PATH=$PDKPATH/libs.tech/klayout:$PDKPATH/libs.tech/klayout/tech/ klayout -e
```

> **_NOTE:_** In this context, `PDKPATH` refers to the path leading to the IHP-Open-PDK/ihp-sg13g2 directory within the current repository.

Then, you will get the DRC menus for SG13G2, you could set your desired options as shown below:

For additional details on GUI options, please refer to the [CLI Options section](#cli).

Finally, after setting your option, you could execute the DRC using `Run Klayout DRC` from the dropdown menu.

Upon executing the DRC, the result database will appear on your layout interface, allowing you to verify the outcome of the run.

**NOTE**

The current SG13G2 DRC rules are categorized as follows:

- **PreCheck Rule Set** ‚Äì Refer to the [README](docs/precheck_rules.md):  
  This set contains the essential DRC rules that are required for baseline verification. All rules in this category have been thoroughly verified, tested, and optimized for performance. This rule set is intended for foundry precheck purposes and can be enabled using the `--precheck_drc` option during DRC execution.

- **Main Rule Set** ‚Äì Refer to the [README](docs/main_rules.md):  
  This set includes rules that were not previously implemented. It also incorporates essential DRC rules already available in the [PreCheck Rule Set](docs/precheck_rules.md).

- **Extra Rule Set** ‚Äì Refer to the [README](docs/extra_rules.md):  
  This set includes additional residual rules that are not part of the main set. These rules can be activated by using the `--extra_rules` switch when executing the DRC. Please note that these rules have not been verified or tested and may be slower.
