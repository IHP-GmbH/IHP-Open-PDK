# XSCHEM configuration 

The library and configuration file `xschemrc` can be found in the directory `libs.tech/xschem`. It configures 
the xschem editor to in order to include PDK root directory, library directories and simulation models. Since the configuration script uses 
`PDK_ROOT` environmental variable, it should be exported before running xschem.

Do it only once:
```bash
export PDK_ROOT=<your_path>/IHP-Open-PDK
./install.py
```
Now you can run xschem and enjoy the examples:

```
xschem
```

## XSCHEM testcases

The top level schematic is `IHP_testcases.sch` can be found at `libs.tech/xschem/sg13g2_tests` directory. 
By default each test case exports the netlist to the `simulations` directory where `.spiceinit`file is used to configure NGSpice in HSPICE compatibility mode. Also a `psp103_nqs.osdi` file is 
by default placed in this directory in order to simulate the MOSFET devices using PSP103 model. This file can be regenerated and updated (if necessary) using method described [here](../verilog-a/README.md).
It is important to notice that the NGSpice version should be 40+ and it has to be compiled using `--enable-osdi` flag as follows:
```
git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/ngspice/ngspice ngspice-ngspice
cd ngspice-ngspice
./configure --enable-osdi
make
sudo make install
```

The `raw` files generated using simulations are placed in `simulations/` folder. If a test case exports CSV file it will be placed in `csv/` directory. The `scripts/` folder contains 
Python scripts, which are used for CSV data post processing. All plots generated by the scripts are exported to the `fig/` directory. More information about test cases can be found
[here](simulations/README.md).
